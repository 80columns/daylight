## What is Daylight?

Daylight is an app for Windows 10 & 11 that changes your theme to light at
sunrise, and to dark at sunset.

## How does it work?

Daylight determines the sunrise & sunset times for your location at startup.
It will first attempt to get your approximate location from your public IP
address. You can also choose to use a custom location for the app by
specifying a city & region, or you can also choose custom sunrise & sunset
times yourself.

## Is my data safe? (aka Privacy)

Daylight is only a local application and does not store your location by
default. If you choose to use a custom location for determining sunrise & sunset
times, Daylight will store that location in its local user settings file (the
default location of this file is C:\Users\<yourusername>\AppData\Local\Programs\
Daylight\UserSettings.json). If you choose to set custom sunrise & sunset times
yourself, Daylight will not use any location information and can be used without
a connection to the internet.
